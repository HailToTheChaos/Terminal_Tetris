    '''## Summary
    The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the game board, prints the initial board, and then enters a loop to handle user input and update the game state until the game is over or the user presses the 'esc' key.

    ## Example Usage
    ```python
    main()
    ```
    ## Code Analysis
    ### Inputs
    - None
    ### Flow
    1. Initialize the game board.
    2. Print the initial board.
    3. Set the initial values for the `key` and `game_over` variables.
    4. Enter a loop that continues until the user presses the 'esc' key or the game is over.
    5. Read the user's keyboard input.
    6. If the input is a key press event, check if it is a valid key for moving the game piece.
    7. If it is a valid key, move the game piece accordingly on the game board.
    8. Check if the game is over by iterating through the first row of the game board and checking if any cell is not empty.
    9. If the game is over, set the `game_over` variable to True to exit the loop.
    ### Outputs
    - None
